          The story of Nuzrat Carpet Emporium is one of tradition, resilience, and excellence. It begins with the vision of the Late Mr. Haji Arman Ali, a farmer who combined his agricultural livelihood with an entrepreneurial spirit in the 1940s. With determination and foresight, he established a small cottage industry in his village, where skilled neighbors and artisans came together to weave hand-knotted carpets. These rugs, rooted in traditional techniques, supplied the local Indian market and quickly became admired for their beauty and durability.
